# Answer Business Questions Using SQL 
Help a Record Store to explore new business opportunity by finding out which gener sells the best in USA, which countries would be our next target market, and which selling option is more profitable.

## Data-based recommendations:
- When add new ablums to store or introduce new aritist, consider those in Rock genre first.
- When come to the Sales Support Agent, go to those with longer working experience for higher sales performance.
- Since the sample size is not large enough to give us high confidence to open a new market, I recommend start with small campaigns in new-found emerging countries that hold the majority of new customers to collect more data.
- Based on my EDA result, I would recommend against purchasing only select tracks from albums from record companies, since customers are more likely to select certain tracks instead of purchasing the whole album.
